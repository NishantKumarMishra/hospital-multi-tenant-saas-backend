# hospital-multi-tenant-saas-backend
This system is designed as a multi-tenant hospital OPD (Out-Patient Department) management platform, where multiple hospitals/clinics operate independently on the same backend while sharing infrastructure securely.  Each request is scoped by user role + hospital context, ensuring strict tenant isolation.
